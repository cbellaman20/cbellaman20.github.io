			<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p> I am from Kensington, Maryland which is right outside of Washington DC. I am a sophmore at UW Madison and I am hoping to study Journalism with a certificate in Design Studies. At UW I am in Alpha Chi Omega and write for the Life and Style section of The Daily Cardinal. You can find these articles by clicking on the picture of the Daily Cardinal below. Over the summer I worked at Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream and traveled to Florida and Chicago. On the other pages of this website you can learn about my family, my favorite movies, foods, and songs, and my dogs.</p>
