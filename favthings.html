			<h3> Movies </h3>
			<p>  My favorite movies are Cheaper by the Dozen 1 and 2 and Just Go with It. I love the Cheaper by the Dozen movies because they remind me of my childhood and make me feel nastalgic. I also love Just Go With It because my family went to the hotel they go to in Hawaii. This movie always reminds me of this trip and how fun it was. My siblings and me watch this movie over and over again because it is so funny and has so many good memories attached to it. I also love Adam Sandler and Jenifer Aniston. Below I attached the trailer to Cheaper By the Dozen and if you click the picture it will take you to YouTube where you can watch it. </p>

			<h4>  My Favorite Songs  </h4>
			<p2>  My favorite singer of all time is Taylor Swift. Summer of 2020 she released Folklore which is my favorite album of all time. On this album there are too many good songs to just pick one as my favorite but my top three are Cardigan, August, and Mirrorball. In the songs Cardigan, August, and Betty, Taylor creates characters and explains a love triangle from each of their perspectives in the three songs. In the love triangle, James cheats on Betty with August and he tries to get Betty back in the song Betty. I love all three of these songs because I think it is so cool how she is able to intertwine them and tell a story. Below I attached the music video for Caridgan and you can watch it by clicking the picture. </p2>
