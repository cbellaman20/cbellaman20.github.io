			<h3> CJ </h3>
			<p>  CJ is a 10 year old Cava tzu, which is a mix between a King Chareles Cavalier and a Shit Tzu. He is about 20 pounds and is white with ruby markings. CJ has the same birthday as my brother Connor so CJ stands for Connor Junior. CJ loves going on walks and playing fetch. But, he is not a fan of other dogs or being held. He will let my family hold him sometimes but he does not love it. CJ used to be really mean to other dogs until we god Crosby in May of 2020. </p>

			<h4>  Crosby  </h4>
			<p2>  Crosby is a one year old Hava Poo, which is a mix between a Havanese and a Poodle. He is a little smaller than CJ and is abiut 15 pounds. We got him during the Covid-19 pandemic so he loves snuggling and being around us. He loves CJ so much and has made CJ much nicer. They both love to play together and Crosby follows CJ everywhere he goes. </p2>
